# laxy
This is my "lazy" wrapper around jax, because I'm too lazy to explicitly write it out each time (set the key/seed for random number generator, setting up the optimizer, keeping track of weights).

Finally implementations of MRF, GRU, LSTM layers are provided implemented, that are not currently part of stax ( jax's experimental NN library).
